# :beers: Brack-Engine

This engine was created as part of the System-Programming minor which took place in the latter half of 2023.  
The engine was designed/build by a team of 5 people.  
The engine architecture mostly adheres to ECS, but due to some of the requirements items like behaviourscripts are also supported. 
A demo game was developed along side of the engine showcasing some of its features.
